Screenshot of base64 encoded text (and a text file), along with a wireshark capture showing MQTT packets being published


encode.py contains code to read the JPG file as bytes, encode the bytes to Base64 and publish the message to broker while also printing the output in a terminal (Note: the b' and ' characters at the beginning and end are /not/ sent via MQTT so there is no need to remove them for MQTT purposes)
